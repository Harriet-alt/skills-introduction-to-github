  <p class="com1">WHY I CHOSE TO STUDY COMUTER ENGINEERING.</p>
     <P>HELLO,</P>
  <p> Let me just go straight to the point.I was forced to do this course. </p>  
  <p>Not nescessaryly forced, i actuallly had no option but to do it</p>
  <p>I don't have any passion for this course . I can't also say i won't do it </p>
  <p>Like i didn't even know i was going to do computer engineer</p>
  <p>Thus i have no reason why i chose computer engineering</p>
  <p> so yeah i'm doing it without any interest.</p>
  <p> Thank you for your time.</p>
